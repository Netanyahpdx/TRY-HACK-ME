- **PROXY**:
  - Most renowned feature.
  - Intercepts & modifies requests & responses during interaction with web applications.

- **REPEATER**:
  - Captures, modifies, & resends the same requests multiple times.
  - Useful for crafting payloads (SQL Injection) & testing endpoint vulnerabilities.

- **INTRUDER**:
  - Allows spraying endpoints with requests (commonly used for brute force attacks/fuzzing).
  - Rate limited in Community Edition.

- **Decoder**:
  - Transforms data by decoding captured information or encoding payloads before sending to the target.
  - Efficient for data manipulation directly within Burp Suite.

- **COMPARER**:
  - Compares 2 pieces of data at the word or byte level.
  - Streamlines comparison of large datasets with keyboard shortcuts.

- **SEQUENCER**:
  - Assesses randomness in tokens like session cookies or other randomly generated data.
